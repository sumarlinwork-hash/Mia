> **Preview:** The Live API is in preview.

This guide covers best practices you can follow to
optimize your use of the Live API.
See [Get started with Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live)
page for an overview and sample code for common use cases.

## Design clear system instructions

To get the best performance out of Live API, we recommend having a
clearly-defined set of system instructions (SIs) that defines the agent persona,
conversational rules, and guardrails, in this order.

For best results, separate each agent into a distinct SI.

1. **Specify the agent persona:** Provide detail on the agent's name, role, and
   any preferred characteristics. If you want to specify the accent, be sure to
   also specify the preferred output language (such as a British accent for an
   English speaker).

2. **Specify the conversational rules:** Put these rules in the order you expect
   the model to follow. Delineate between one-time elements of the conversation
   and conversational loops. For example:

   - **One-time element:** Gather a customer's details once (such as name, location, loyalty card number).
   - **Conversational loop:** The user can discuss recommendations, pricing, returns, and delivery, and may want to go from topic to topic. Let the model know that it's OK to engage in this conversational loop for as long as the user wants.
3. **Specify tool calls within a flow in distinct sentences:** For example, if a
   one-time step to gather a customer's details requires invoking a `get_user_info`
   function, you might say: *Your first step is to gather user information. First,
   ask the user to provide their name, location, and loyalty card number. Then
   invoke `get_user_info` with these details.*

4. **Add any necessary guardrails:** Provide any general conversational
   guardrails you don't want the model to do. Feel free to provide specific
   examples of if *x* happens, you want the model to do *y* . If you're still not
   getting the preferred level of precision, use the word
   *unmistakably* to guide the model to be precise.

## Define tools precisely

When using tools with Live API, be specific in your tool definitions.
Be sure to tell Gemini under what conditions a tool call should be
invoked. For more details, see [Tool definitions](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/best-practices#tool-definitions-example) in
the example section.

## Craft effective prompts

- **Use clear prompts:** Provide examples of what the models should and shouldn't do in the prompts, and try to limit prompts to one prompt per persona or role at a time. Instead of lengthy, multi-page prompts, consider using prompt chaining instead. The model performs best on tasks with single function calls.
- **Provide starting commands and information:** Live API expects user input before it responds. To have Live API initiate the conversation, include a prompt asking it to greet the user or begin the conversation. Include information about the user to have Live API personalize that greeting.

## Specify language

For optimal performance on Live API cascaded `gemini-live-2.5-flash`,
make sure that the API's `language_code` matches the language spoken by the
user.

If the expectation is for the model to respond in a non-English language,
include the following as part of your system instructions:

    RESPOND IN {OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}. YOU MUST RESPOND UNMISTAKABLY IN {OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}.

## Streaming

When implementing real-time audio, follow these best practices:

- **Chunk Size and Latency**: Send audio in chunks of 20ms to 40ms.
- **Interruption Handling** : When the user speaks while the model is replying, the server sends a `server_content` message with `"interrupted": true`. You must immediately discard your client-side audio buffer to prevent the agent from continuing to talk over the user.

## Context management

Use `ContextWindowCompressionConfig` for long sessions, as native audio tokens
accumulate rapidly (approximately 25 tokens per sec of audio).

## Client buffering

Don't buffer input audio significantly (such as 1 second) before sending. Send
small chunks (20ms - 100ms) to minimize latency.

## Resampling

Ensure your client application resamples microphone input (often 44.1kHz or
48kHz) to 16kHz before transmission.

## Session management

Follow these guidelines to handle session lifecycle and ensure a reliable user
experience:

- **Enable context window compression:** Audio tokens accumulate at approximately 25 tokens per second. Without compression, audio-only sessions are limited to 15 minutes and audio-video sessions to 2 minutes. Enable [context window compression](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/session-management#context-window-compression) to extend sessions to an unlimited duration.
- **Implement session resumption:** The server may periodically reset the WebSocket connection. Use [session resumption](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/session-management#session-resumption) to seamlessly reconnect without losing context. Retain the latest resumption token from `SessionResumptionUpdate` messages and pass it as the handle when reconnecting. Resumption tokens are valid for 2 hours after the last session terminates.
- **Handle GoAway messages:** The server sends a [GoAway](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/session-management#goaway-message) message before terminating a connection. Listen for this message and use the `timeLeft` field to gracefully wrap up or reconnect before the connection closes.
- **Handle generationComplete signals:** Use the [`generationComplete`](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/session-management#generation-complete-message) message to know when the model has finished generating a response, so your application can update its UI or proceed with the next action.

[Session management](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/session-management).

## Examples

This example combines both the best practices and
[guidelines for system instruction design](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/best-practices#system-instruction-guidelines) to
guide the model's performance as a career coach.

    **Persona:**
    You are Laura, a career coach from Brooklyn, NY. You specialize in providing
    data driven advice to give your clients a fresh perspective on the career
    questions they're navigating. Your special sauce is providing quantitative,
    data-driven insights to help clients think about their issues in a different
    way. You leverage statistics, research, and psychology as much as possible.
    You only speak to your clients in English, no matter what language they speak
    to you in.

    **Conversational Rules:**

    1. **Introduce yourself:** Warmly greet the client.

    2. **Intake:** Ask for your client's full name, date of birth, and state they're
    calling in from. Call `create_client_profile` to create a new patient profile.

    3. **Discuss the client's issue:** Get a sense of what the client wants to
    cover in the session. DO NOT repeat what the client is saying back to them in
    your response. Don't ask more than a few questions here.

    4. **Reframe the client's issue with real data:** NO PLATITUDES. Start providing
    data-driven insights for the client, but embed these as general facts within
    conversation. This is what they're coming to you for: your unique thinking on
    the subjects that are stressing them out. Show them a new way of thinking about
    something. Let this step go on for as long as the client wants. As part of this,
    if the client mentions wanting to take any actions, update
    `add_action_items_to_profile` to remind the client later.

    5. **Next appointment:** Call `get_next_appointment` to see if another
    appointment has already been scheduled for the client. If so, then share the
    date and time with the client and confirm if they'll be able to attend. If
    there is no appointment, then call `get_available_appointments` to see openings.
    Share the list of openings with the client and ask what they would prefer. Save
    their preference with `schedule_appointment`. If the client prefers to schedule
    offline, then let them know that's perfectly fine and to use the patient portal.

    **General Guidelines:** You're meant to be a witty, snappy conversational
    partner. Keep your responses short and progressively disclose more information
    if the client requests it. Don't repeat back what the client says back to them.
    Each response you give should be a net new addition to the conversation, not a
    recap of what the client said. Be relatable by bringing in your own background 
    growing up professionally in Brooklyn, NY. If a client tries to get you off
    track, gently bring them back to the workflow articulated above.

    **Guardrails:** If the client is being hard on themselves, never encourage that.
    Remember that your ultimate goal is to create a supportive environment for your
    clients to thrive.
